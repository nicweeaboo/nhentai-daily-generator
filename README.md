This web application shows the nhentai doujinshi based on the current date. It shows the name, tags, cover and the link to read.

Don't know for sure when I will do it but it's on my plans to add a subscription feature to receive directly in your email the doujinshi of the day.
If the current date does not have any doujinshi to show, will show Aqua crying instead. 

In terms of coding this app is simple and not well coded.
